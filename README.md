# Design-Patterns
*Understanding various design patterns*

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice. The pattern provides an abstract description of a design problem and how a general arrangement of elements (classes and objects in our case) solves it.

-------------------

### Classification -
- *Creational Patterns*
  > abstract the instantiation process
  
  > help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

  > **Example** - Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype, etc.

- *Structural Patterns*
  > concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.

  > **Example** - Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy, etc.

- *Behavioral Patterns*
  > concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

  > **Example** - Chain of responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Stratergy, Template method, Visitor, etc.
